# Arduino-Motorized-Camera-Slider

Arduino Code for the motorized camera slider project.


NOTE:

When testing the stepper motor, you may have to adjust the current using the easy driver's onboard potentiometer. the general rule of thumb is to turn the current all the way down (ie. until the motor doesnt move) then slowly turn the potentiometer the other way until you have sufficient torque for your application (within the spec of the motor, of course)


NOTE 2:

If you find that the OLED screen you have doesn't work... it may be that the I2C address is different from the one I used. There are various I2C address "finders" that you can download as ardunio sketchs to figure out your I2C address.

ToDo - 

Add panning functionality

make phone app?
